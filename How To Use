Steps to Run the Python Script for Log Parser

Before Running the Program make sure Python is installed - 
additionally the database for geoip2 needs to be installed and you need to point the code to the downloaded file (line:13, log_parser.py)
Example: # Path to the GeoLite2 database (adjust as needed) in log_parser.py
GEOIP_DB_PATH = "C:/Users/BroBy/OneDrive/Desktop/GeoLite2-City.mmdb"
(https://www.maxmind.com/en/accounts/1097967/geoip/downloads)
additionally the access.log needs to be downloaded and in the same directory as log_parser.py

1. Download the Script 
   Save the Python script (`log_parser.py`) to a directory where you want to keep it.  

2. Prepare the Log File
   Place your `access.log` file in the same directory as the script.

3. Open the Command Prompt  
   Open a command prompt or terminal, and navigate to the directory containing your files.  
   Example:  
   cd /users/auser/project

4. Run the Script
   Use one of the following commands, depending on your analysis needs:  

   - Analyze with Time Window and Threshold:
     python log_analysis.py /path/to/log/file --time_window <value> --threshold <value>
     Replace `<value>` with your desired parameters.  
     Example:  
         python log_parser.py access.log --time_window 10 --threshold 5

   - Search for Specific Patterns (e.g., Failed Logins): 
     python log_parser.py /path/to/log/file --search "failed login"

5. Review the Results
   The script will display suspicious activity, such as repeated failed login attempts.  
   Example Output:  

           Suspicious IP addresses with repeated failed login attempts:
           
           IP: 192.168.1.1
             - Line: 45, Date/Time: 2024-12-04 14:23:45+0000, Country: United States
             - Line: 78, Date/Time: 2024-12-04 14:24:30+0000, Country: United States
        
           IP: 203.0.113.5
             - Line: 102, Date/Time: 2024-12-04 14:25:10+0000, Country: Unknown
